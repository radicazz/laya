# AGENTS.md

Robots: obey these rules or be unplugged.

## Topology

- This file: global agent rules. Directory-level AGENTS.md files provide local guidance.
- For project goals: see [README.md](README.md).
- For style and philosophy: see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Directives

- Always prefer minimal, precise changes.
- Reference directory AGENTS.md files for context-specific instructions.
- Scripts, tools, and tests have their own AGENTS.md files—consult them before acting in those areas.
- Follow conventional commit prefixes (e.g., feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, test:) for commit messages.
