## 💡 What Makes Laya Different?

✅ **RAII everywhere** – No manual cleanup, no resource leaks  
✅ **Type-safe** – Strong types prevent parameter mix-ups at compile time  
✅ **Modern C++20** – Concepts, `std::variant`, `std::format`, constexpr  
✅ **Thin wrapper** – Near-zero overhead, direct mapping to SDL3  
✅ **No SDL exposure** – Clean public API hides SDL internals
